Description: library implementing json-rpc C++ clients
 This library provides classes to easily implement JSON-RPC C++ clients.
 It comes with a built in HTTP-Client connector (based on libcurl)
 for easy data exchange. It is fully JSON-RPC 2.0 and JSON-RPC
 1.0 compatible, including:
 .
  * Type checking
  * Error response handling
  * Batch procedure calls
  * JSON-RPC Method invocation
  * JSON-RPC Notification invocation
  * Interface for additional Client-Connectors beside HTTP
  * Positional and named parameters

Description: library for stub generation of libjsonrpccpp based applications
 This package provides the stub generator library for the libjson-rpc-cpp
 framework. It can automatically generate full functioning C++ and JavaScript
 JSON-RPC Client classes, which are ready to use.
 .
 For JSON-RPC Server applications, this library can generate an abstract C++
 class which just has to be sub classed and implement all pure virtual methods.
 To make this possible, a interface description file (in the JSON format)
 is required, which lists all available methods with corresponding parameters
 and types.
